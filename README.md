# Analysis Code Samples

This repository contains simplified code examples representative of my PhD work
in experimental nuclear and particle physics. The examples use non-sensitive or
dummy data and are intended to demonstrate coding style and analysis approaches.

## Contents

- C++ waveform extraction from ABCD DAQ `.adr` files
- ROOT-based analysis of HPGe detector data
- Python analysis of GEANT4 simulation results
